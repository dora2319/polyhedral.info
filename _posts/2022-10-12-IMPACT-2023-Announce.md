This is a CALL FOR PAPERS for


    IMPACT 2023


13th International Workshop on

Polyhedral Compilation Techniques


  https://impact-workshop.org


held in conjunction with HiPEAC 2023 in Toulouse, France.


======================================

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission:    November 27, 2022 (AoE)

Author notification: December 19, 2022

Final version due:   January 12, 2023 (AoE)

Workshop:            January 16, 2023

======================================


For this edition we accept two kinds of submissions: paper submissions 

and presentation-only submissions.



OVERVIEW:


Polyhedral compilation techniques receive more attention than ever

from both researchers and practitioners. Thanks to a unified formalism

for parallelization and memory optimization, polyhedral techniques

play a central role in a wide range of domain-specific languages and

optimizing compilers, with high impact in competitive areas such as

machine learning, scientific computing and media processing.


IMPACT is a unique event focusing on polyhedral compilation. The

workshop brings together researchers and practitioners for a

high-quality one-day event including a keynote, paper presentations,

and work-in-progress discussions. The workshop has a well

established tradition of high quality, extensive peer reviews, with a

PC balancing core polyhedral expertise with applications and broader

computing systems research.


We welcome both theoretical and experimental papers and presentations 

on all aspects of polyhedral compilation. We also welcome submissions describing

preliminary results, crazy new ideas, position papers, experience

reports, education material, and available tools, with an aim to

stimulate discussions, collaborations, and advances in the field. The

following illustrate potential IMPACT papers:


- Thorough theoretical discussion of a preliminary idea with an attempt to

  place it in context but no experimental results.


- Experimental results comparing two or more existing ideas, followed by a

  detailed analysis.


- Presentation of an existing idea in a different way, including

  illustrations of how the idea applies to new use cases, code,

  architectures, etc.  Attribution should be as clear as possible.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- program optimization (automatic parallelization, tiling, etc.);

- code generation;

- data/communication management on GPUs, accelerators and distributed

  systems;

- hardware/high-level synthesis for affine programs;

- static analysis;

- program verification;

- model checking;

- theoretical foundations of the polyhedral model;

- extensions of the polyhedral model;

- scalability and robustness of polyhedral compilation techniques.



PAPER SUBMISSION:


Paper submissions should not exceed 10 pages (recommended 8 pages), excluding

references, formatted as per ACM SIGPLAN proceedings format. 

Short paper submissions, even with only 2 pages, are welcome as well.


Use version 1.54 or above of the following templates to prepare your manuscript:


  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template


Make sure to use the "sigplan" subformat. Visit


  http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/


for further information on SIGPLAN manuscript formatting.

NOTE: older versions of the article template use smaller fonts for

submission, please double-check that you are using the recent style file

(in particular, various LaTeX distributions ship older versions of the

acmart style file, please download the most recent one from ACM).


Submissions should use PDF format and be printable on US Letter or A4

paper. Please submit your manuscripts through EasyChair and while selecting

"Paper" as submission type:


  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=impact2023


Proceedings will be posted online. If the final version of an accepted

paper does not sufficiently address the comments of the reviewers, then

it may be accompanied by a note from the program committee. Publication

at IMPACT will not prevent later publication in conferences or journals

of the presented work. However, simultaneous submission to IMPACT and

other workshop, conference, or journal is often prohibited by the policy

of other venues. For instance, a manuscript overlapping significantly

with IMPACT submission cannot be submitted to PLDI 2023 or any other

overlapping SIGPLAN event.


Please make sure that at least one of the authors can attend the

workshop if your work is accepted to give a 25 minutes presentation of 

your work.



PRESENTATION-ONLY SUBMISSION:


Submit a summary of your presentation through EasyChair:


  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=impact2023


Submissions have no formatting requirements but should use PDF formal. 

Choose "Presentation-only" when submitting. 


The presentation should take no longer than 25 minutes to present. 

Please make sure that at least one of the authors can attend the workshop 

if your work is accepted.
