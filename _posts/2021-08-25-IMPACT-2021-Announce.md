# IMPACT 2022 announcement

Held in conjunction with [HiPEAC 2022] (https://www.hipeac.net/2022/budapest/#/)(Jan 16-18), 2022.

The event will be hybrid, i.e., both physical and virtual attendance is possible.


# Overview

With multicore processors, hardware accelerators, and deep memory
hierarchies remaining the main sources of performance and
energy-efficiency, polyhedral compilation techniques receive more
attention than ever from both researchers and practitioners. Thanks
to a unified formalism for parallelization and memory optimization,
these techniques are now powering domain-specific language compilers
yielding best performance in highly competitive areas such as machine
learning and numeric simulation. IMPACT is a unique event focusing
exclusively on polyhedral compilation that brings together researchers
and practitioners for a high-quality one-day event including a keynote
and selected paper presentations.
